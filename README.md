# underscore_py
A blatant rewrite of (most of ) the [Javascript underscore module](http://underscorejs.org/) to Python. I found the Javascript module very useful when using Javascript, no reason why not have the same facility in Python...

Documentation is included in the repo, and also [available online](https://cdn.rawgit.com/iherman/underscore_py/master/Doc/build/html/index.html)
